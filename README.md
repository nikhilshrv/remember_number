# Write a system to remember numbers in range 1 - 20M. 
## It will have 3 main functions
- `rememberNumber(number)` : input will be of type number and it should store the number in memory. This can be called again and again with different numbers
- `doesNumberExist(number)` : input will be of type number and it should return true if a number exists and false if it does not
- `forgetNumber(number)` : input will be of type number and it should remove the number from memory if it exists.


### Optimize for memory & time.

Solution:

I have written the program in `TypeScript`. The source code is in `src/main.ts`

I have also written few test cases and I am using `Jest` to run the `tests`.

Steps to execute the program
- npm install
- npm test
